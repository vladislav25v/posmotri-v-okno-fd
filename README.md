# Look Out the Window (Project Work)

This project was developed as part of the Yandex Practicum Frontend Developer course. The goal of the project is to reinforce theoretical knowledge and practice the skills of semantic markup, styling, and accessibility within a real layout case.

## 🚀 What I Learned

Throughout the project, I gained practical experience with the following topics:

### HTML & Semantic Markup

- Correct use of semantic HTML5 elements to improve accessibility.
- Structuring content with `article`, `header`, `footer`, `section`, and `main` elements.
- Implementation of visually hidden content for screen readers using accessibility best practices.

### CSS Styling Techniques

- Use of modern layout tools like Flexbox and Grid.
- Styling interactive elements using pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:focus-visible`, and `:active`.
- Creation of clean and consistent spacing using margins, paddings, and outline techniques.
- Handling box overflow and managing collapsed and fallen margins.

### Accessibility (a11y)

- Accessible form structure and labeling using `label`, `fieldset`, and `legend`.
- Proper use of `aria` attributes and visual focus indicators.
- Strategies to support users with reduced motion and increased contrast preferences.
- Understanding and improving the accessibility tree.

### Responsive Design

- Image optimization with modern formats and proper use of `alt` text for visuals.
- Embedding external media using `iframe` and `video` with accessibility considerations.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
- VS Code with Live Server
- Git for version control

## 🧠 Summary

This project allowed me to consolidate my knowledge of layout techniques, improve code accessibility, and work through real-world layout issues like focus visibility and spacing. The iterative debugging process and testing for screen reader compatibility gave me a much deeper understanding of practical frontend development.
